# Snake Game
This project is a classic Snake Game created as part of a final assignment for the Processing Java Bootcamp. The user will be able to control their snake, collect food, and grow while avoiding itself. The game features intuitive controls, contains colorful graphics, and a score-tracking system.

## Features
- **Intuitive Controls:** Use arrow keys to guide your snake.
- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of your high scores.
- **Endless Fun:** Play the game repeatedly to improve your skills.
  
## Lessons Learned
During the development of this Snake Game project, I learnt several lessons that have contributed to my growth as a developer:

-  **Loop Understanding:** I gained a deeper understanding of iteration and how it enables the game to run smoothly. 

- **Collision Handling:** Handling collisions between the snake and itself, and the snake and the food. It taught me the importance of how the branch statements need to be accurate, otherwise the condition may be ignored completely.

- **Code Organization:** Properly structuring the code for the game helped me manage complexity and make the project more maintainable. I learned about the significance of code modularity and object oriented programming within Processing.

## Run Locally
    1. Clone or download the repository.
    2. Open the project in Processing.
    3. Run the sketch to start the game.
    4. Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
